**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** (December 27, 2025)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Severity** | Critical (CVSS 9.1) |
| **Component** | MCP Services (customer-data, bss-oss, knowledge-graph) |
| **Vulnerability** | Missing authentication on all MCP endpoints |
| **Fixed In** | v1.1.0 |
| **Impact** | Unauthenticated access to sensitive customer data, product catalog, and business logic |
| **Mitigation** | Implemented comprehensive API key authentication with rate limiting and audit logging |

**Description:** All three MCP services (customer-data-mcp, bss-oss-mcp, knowledge-graph-mcp) accepted unauthenticated requests, allowing any client to access sensitive customer profiles, product catalogs, and business intelligence without authentication. This exposed PII data and business-critical information to potential unauthorized access.

**Resolution:** Implemented comprehensive authentication and security controls:

1. **API Key Authentication**
   - Cryptographically secure API keys (base64-encoded 32-byte random values)
   - Three-tier key system: BUSINESS_INTENT, ADMIN, MONITORING
   - Secure storage in Kubernetes secrets with rotation procedures

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - 100 requests per minute per API key
   - Configurable time windows
   - Prevents abuse and DoS attacks

3. **Request Signing Verification**
   - HMAC signature validation capability
   - Timestamp-based replay attack prevention
   - Optional for enhanced security

4. **Comprehensive Audit Logging**
   - All MCP requests logged with timestamp, client, endpoint, and result
   - Authentication failures tracked separately
   - Service-specific logging for correlation

5. **Health Check Exception**
   - Health endpoints remain accessible for monitoring
   - All business logic endpoints require authentication

**Verification:**
```bash
# Test unauthenticated request (should fail)
curl -X POST http://customer-data-mcp:8080/mcp/tools/call
# Response: 401 Unauthorized - Authentication required

# Test with valid API key (should succeed)
curl -X POST http://customer-data-mcp:8080/mcp/tools/call \
  -H "X-API-Key: $MCP_API_KEY_BUSINESS_INTENT"
# Response: 200 OK with data
```

**Affected Services:**
- customer-data-mcp-service:1.0.0 → 1.1.0
- bss-oss-mcp-service:1.0.0 → 1.1.0
- knowledge-graph-mcp-service:1.1.0 → 1.1.0

**Key Rotation Schedule:**
- Rotation required every 90 days
- Immediate rotation if compromise suspected
- Documented in `mcp-services-k8s/mcp-secrets.yaml`

### MED-001: Anthropic API Key Exposure Pattern

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** (December 27, 2025)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Severity** | Medium (CVSS 5.3) |
| **Component** | business-intent-agent |
| **Vulnerability** | API key exposed in environment variables |
| **Fixed In** | v1.1.0 |
| **Impact** | API key visible in process listings and container inspect commands |
| **Mitigation** | Implemented file-based secret reading with fallback to environment variables |

**Description:** The Anthropic API key was being loaded directly from environment variables (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), making it visible in process listings (`ps aux`), container inspect commands (`docker inspect`), and Kubernetes pod descriptions. This exposure pattern increases the risk of credential leakage through various monitoring and debugging tools.

**Resolution:** Implemented a secure secret management pattern that prioritizes file-based secrets:

1. **Secrets Utility Module** (`src/secrets.ts`)
   - Dual-mode secret reading: file-based with environment variable fallback
   - File path specified via `<SECRET_NAME>_FILE` environment variable
   - Automatic secret trimming (removes whitespace/newlines)
   - Comprehensive logging for audit trail
   - Graceful error handling with fallback mechanism

2. **Kubernetes Configuration**
   - Secret mounted as file at `/run/secrets/anthropic_api_key`
   - Environment variable `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_FILE` points to file path
   - Volume mount configured with read-only access
   - Secret file permissions managed by Kubernetes

3. **Docker Compose Configuration**
   - Docker Secrets integration (`/run/secrets/anthropic_api_key`)
   - Secret file sourced from `./secrets/anthropic_api_key.txt`
   - Consistent pattern with other service secrets (PostgreSQL, Neo4j, Grafana)

**Benefits:**
- ✅ API key not visible in environment variables
- ✅ Reduced exposure in process listings
- ✅ File permissions provide additional access control
- ✅ Backward compatible (environment variable fallback)
- ✅ Consistent with Docker/Kubernetes best practices

**Verification:**
```bash
# Kubernetes: Secret mounted as file
kubectl exec -it business-intent-agent-xxx -- ls -la /run/secrets/
# -r--r----- 1 root root 43 Dec 27 12:00 anthropic_api_key

# Environment variable points to file, not secret value
kubectl exec -it business-intent-agent-xxx -- env | grep ANTHROPIC
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_FILE=/run/secrets/anthropic_api_key

# Docker Compose: Secret accessible via file
docker exec business-intent-agent ls -la /run/secrets/
# -r--r----- 1 root root 43 Dec 27 12:00 anthropic_api_key
```

**Backward Compatibility:**
The implementation maintains backward compatibility by supporting both patterns:
- **Preferred**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_FILE` (file path)
- **Fallback**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (direct value)

This allows gradual migration and ensures existing deployments continue functioning.

### API3: Broken Object Property Level Authorization

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED** (December 27, 2025)

| Attribute | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| **Severity** | Medium (CVSS 6.5) |
| **Component** | business-intent-agent API responses |
| **Vulnerability** | Excessive data exposure, no field-level access control, mass assignment |
| **Fixed In** | v1.1.0 |
| **Impact** | API responses contained sensitive PII regardless of user role |
| **Mitigation** | Implemented role-based field filtering and mass assignment protection |

**Description:** The API was returning complete customer profiles including sensitive PII (email, phone, credit scores) to all authenticated users without field-level authorization checks. Additionally, there was no mass assignment protection on input fields, allowing clients to potentially inject unexpected data.

**Vulnerabilities Identified:**
1. **Excessive Data Exposure**: All customer profile fields returned regardless of user role
2. **No Field-Level Authorization**: Same data returned to customers, agents, and admins
3. **Mass Assignment**: No input field whitelisting on POST endpoints
4. **PII Over-Sharing**: Email, phone numbers exposed in API responses

**Resolution:** Implemented comprehensive field-level authorization controls:

**1. Role-Based Access Control** (`src/response-filter.ts`)
- **Customer Role**: Limited access - own data only, PII redacted
  - Email, phone: `[REDACTED]`
  - Credit score: Generalized to tier (high/medium/low)
  - Location: City and country only
  - Name: Replaced with `[Authenticated User]`

- **Agent Role**: Support agent access - customer data, some PII
  - Can view customer profiles for support
  - Email and phone still redacted
  - Credit score visible for risk assessment

- **Admin Role**: Full access - all data including PII
  - Complete customer profiles
  - All financial data
  - Debug and internal fields

- **System Role**: Internal system - full access for integrations

**2. Field-Level Permissions Matrix**
```typescript
FIELD_PERMISSIONS = {
  'email': [Admin, System],              // Admin only
  'phone': [Admin, System],              // Admin only
  'credit_score': [Agent, Admin, System], // Not for customers
  'name': [Agent, Admin, System],        // Hashed for customers
  'customer_id': [All roles],             // All can see
  'segment': [All roles],                 // All can see
  // ... complete matrix in code
}
```

**3. Mass Assignment Protection**
- Input field whitelisting for all POST endpoints
- Only allowed fields accepted from client
- Unexpected fields trigger warning and rejection
- Audit logging of mass assignment attempts

**4. Response Filter Middleware**
- Automatic filtering of all API responses
- Applied globally to all endpoints
- Filters nested objects recursively
- Comprehensive audit logging

**Benefits:**
- ✅ PII exposure limited to authorized roles
- ✅ Principle of least privilege enforced
- ✅ Mass assignment attacks prevented
- ✅ Automatic response filtering (no developer errors)
- ✅ Comprehensive audit trail
- ✅ OWASP API Security Top 10 compliant

**Verification:**
```bash
# Customer role - limited data
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer customer-key" /api/v1/intent
{
  "customer_profile": {
    "customer_id": "CUST-001",
    "segment": "premium",
    "email": "[REDACTED]",      # ✅ Redacted
    "phone": "[REDACTED]",      # ✅ Redacted
    "credit_score": "high"      # ✅ Generalized
  }
}

# Admin role - full data
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer admin-key" /api/v1/intent
{
  "customer_profile": {
    "customer_id": "CUST-001",
    "email": "john@example.com",  # ✅ Visible
    "phone": "+353-1-234-5678",   # ✅ Visible
    "credit_score": "excellent"   # ✅ Detailed
  }
}

# Mass assignment protection
curl -X POST /api/v1/intent \
  -d '{"customerId":"CUST-001","intent":"upgrade","malicious":"field"}'
# Response: 400 Bad Request - "Request contains unexpected fields"
```
