# Architecture Productivity Guide

> **Guide Origin**: Official | **ArcKit Version**: [VERSION]

ArcKit generates architecture artifacts in Markdown, but governance boards, procurement panels, and senior stakeholders expect Word documents, PDF packs, slide decks, and spreadsheets. Anthropic's document skills bridge that gap — letting you convert ArcKit output into polished, client-ready deliverables without leaving Claude Code.

## Skill-by-Skill Playbook

### PDF (`/pdf`)

Create sealed, read-only documents for compliance evidence and formal sign-off.

| ArcKit Command | Why PDF |
|----------------|---------|
| `/arckit:secure` | Security assessment locked for audit trail |
| `/arckit:dpia` | Data Protection Impact Assessment for the DPO |
| `/arckit:tcop` | Technology Code of Practice compliance record |
| `/arckit:risk` | Risk register snapshot for governance review |
| `/arckit:principles-compliance` | Principles compliance evidence for architecture board |

**Example** — compliance evidence pack from a Scottish Courts AI governance project:

```text
Read projects/014-scottish-courts/ARC-014-SECD-v1.0.md and
projects/014-scottish-courts/ARC-014-DPIA-v1.0.md and
projects/014-scottish-courts/ARC-014-TCOP-v1.0.md then use /pdf
to create a combined compliance evidence PDF with
"OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE" classification banner on every page.
Save to exports/ARC-014-compliance-evidence.pdf
```

---

### DOCX (`/docx`)

Create editable Word documents for governance boards that mark up and comment on submissions.

| ArcKit Command | Why DOCX |
|----------------|----------|
| `/arckit:sobc` | Strategic Outline Business Case for board approval |
| `/arckit:sow` | Statement of Work for procurement negotiation |
| `/arckit:requirements` | Requirements specification for stakeholder review |
| `/arckit:strategy` | Strategy document for executive circulation |
| `/arckit:stakeholders` | Stakeholder analysis for project initiation |

**Example** — board submission from a Windows 11 deployment project:

```text
Read projects/003-windows11/ARC-003-SOBC-v1.0.md then use /docx
to create a Word document with Document Control table on page 1,
executive summary on page 2, and all sections following.
Add "DRAFT — For Board Review" watermark.
Save to exports/ARC-003-SOBC-board-submission.docx
```

---

### PPTX (`/pptx`)

Create slide decks for steering committees, show-and-tells, and stakeholder briefings.

| ArcKit Command | Why PPTX |
|----------------|----------|
| `/arckit:presentation` | Architecture overview already structured for slides |
| `/arckit:stakeholders` | Stakeholder map and power/interest grid for kick-off |
| `/arckit:roadmap` | Technology roadmap for steering committee |
| `/arckit:plan` | Architecture plan milestones for project board |
| `/arckit:sobc` | Executive summary slides from business case |

**Example** — steering committee deck from a fuel price transparency project:

```text
Read projects/017-fuel-prices/ARC-017-PRES-v1.0.md then use /pptx
to create a 12-slide deck with: title slide, problem statement,
proposed architecture, key risks, roadmap, and next steps.
Use dark blue title bars and white body text.
Save to exports/ARC-017-steering-deck.pptx
```

---

### XLSX (`/xlsx`)

Create sortable, filterable spreadsheets for analysis workflows and tool imports.

| ArcKit Command | Why XLSX |
|----------------|----------|
| `/arckit:evaluate` | Vendor evaluation matrix with weighted scores |
| `/arckit:risk` | Risk register with likelihood/impact heatmap |
| `/arckit:backlog` | User stories for Jira or Azure DevOps import |
| `/arckit:finops` | Cost breakdown with pivot-ready data |
| `/arckit:requirements` | Requirements table for traceability matrix |

**Example** — vendor evaluation matrix from a Windows 11 deployment project:

```text
Read projects/003-windows11/ARC-003-EVAL-v1.0.md then use /xlsx
to create a spreadsheet with: Sheet 1 "Scoring Matrix" with
weighted scores and conditional formatting (green/amber/red),
Sheet 2 "Raw Data" with all vendor responses.
Save to exports/ARC-003-vendor-evaluation.xlsx
```

## Tips

**Branding in prompts** — Include your organisation's colours, logo placement, and font preferences in the skill prompt. For UK Government documents, add the classification banner (e.g., "OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE") as a header on every page.

**MARP vs `/pptx`** — ArcKit's `/arckit:presentation` command generates MARP Markdown for quick slide previews. Use `/pptx` when you need a polished PowerPoint file with custom formatting, animations, or corporate templates. Both approaches work — MARP for speed, `/pptx` for polish.

**Keep exports outside `projects/`** — Save document skill output to an `exports/` folder at the repo root. The `projects/` directory is for ArcKit's versioned Markdown artifacts. Keeping exports separate avoids cluttering the artifact tree and makes `.gitignore` patterns simpler.

**Re-export after updates** — When ArcKit auto-versions an artifact (e.g., `v1.0` to `v1.1`), re-run the document skill to keep exports in sync. The Markdown source is always the single source of truth.

**Batch processing** — You can convert multiple artifacts in a single prompt. Ask Claude to read several files and produce one combined document, or create separate files in a batch.
