## One-Page Workflow

| Phase | Key Activities | ArcKit Commands |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| Discovery | Product type and data flows | `/arckit:requirements`, `/arckit:data-model` |
| Risk | Data sharing and trade secret risks | `/arckit:risk` |

## Review Checklist

- Role(s) determined (manufacturer / data holder / DAPS / public body).
- Connected product scope confirmed (IoT, industrial equipment, smart appliances).
- Personal data vs non-personal data split identified.
- User data access rights (Ch. II) assessed if manufacturer/data holder.
- B2B FRAND terms documented.
- Cloud switching obligations (Ch. VI) assessed if DAPS.
- Egress charge elimination by September 2027 flagged if DAPS.
- International transfer restrictions (Art. 27) assessed.
- GDPR intersection documented.

## Key Notes

- **Application date**: 12 September 2025 for most obligations; September 2027 for egress charge elimination.
- **Data Act ≠ GDPR**: Data Act covers non-personal IoT data. GDPR still applies when personal data is in the dataset.
- **Trade secrets**: Explicitly protected — manufacturers can refuse sharing if trade secrets at risk, but must document and cannot use this as blanket refusal.
- **SecNumCloud intersection**: Art. 27 international transfer restrictions reinforce DINUM cloud doctrine.
