# Autoresearch Guide: Self-Improving Command Prompts

> **Guide Origin**: Official | **ArcKit Version**: [VERSION]

ArcKit includes an autonomous prompt optimisation system inspired by [karpathy/autoresearch](https://github.com/karpathy/autoresearch). It lets Claude Code iteratively improve any command prompt by running it, scoring the output, tweaking the prompt, and keeping or discarding the change based on whether quality improved.

You start a run and walk away. The system loops until you stop it.

---

## Quick Start

In the ArcKit repo, tell Claude Code:

```text
read scripts/autoresearch/program.md and optimise the requirements command
```

Replace `requirements` with any command name (e.g., `adr`, `backlog`, `risk`, `stakeholders`).

Claude will:

1. Create a git worktree (`../autoresearch-requirements`) on a new branch -- your main checkout stays clean
2. Set up a scratch project with fixture data inside the worktree
3. Run the command, score the output, log the baseline
4. Enter the experiment loop -- tweaking, re-running, keeping or discarding

To stop: interrupt Claude at any time. The worktree has the best prompt.

---

## How It Works

The system adapts autoresearch's ML experiment loop to prompt engineering:

- **autoresearch**: modifies `train.py` to minimise `val_bpb`
- **ArcKit autoresearch**: modifies a command `.md` file to maximise a quality score

### The Loop

Each iteration follows the same cycle:

1. **Read** the current prompt and results history
2. **Identify** one specific improvement
3. **Edit** the command `.md` file
4. **Commit** the change to git
5. **Clean** the scratch project (delete generated artifacts, keep fixtures)
6. **Execute** the command against the scratch project
7. **Score** the output (structural checks then LLM-as-judge)
8. **Compare** to the previous best score
9. **Keep or discard** based on a minimum delta threshold (>= 0.3)
10. **Log** the result to `results.tsv`

If discarded, the prompt is reverted via `git checkout` to the previous best version. The full history (including discards) is preserved in `results.tsv`.

### Status Line

After each iteration, a status line is printed:

```text
[iter 3] score: 9.2 (best: 8.8) | effort: high model: inherit | status: keep | keeps: 3 discards: 1 | streak: 0/15 to plateau
```

This gives live terminal visibility without needing to read files.

## Evaluation: Two Layers

### Layer 1: Structural Gate (pass/fail)

Eight checks that must all pass:

1. Document Control table with all 14 required fields
2. Document ID follows `ARC-NNN-TYPE-vX.Y` pattern
3. Revision History table present
4. Standard footer present
5. All major template sections present
6. File written to correct path
7. Domain-specific IDs correct (BR-xxx, FR-xxx, etc.)
8. Wardley Map math validation (WARD commands only): stage-evolution alignment, coordinate range [0.00-1.00], OWM-to-table consistency

If any check fails, the iteration scores `FAIL 0.0` and is discarded immediately.

### Layer 2: LLM-as-Judge (1.0-10.0)

Five dimensions, each scored 1-10:

- **Completeness** -- all sections substantively filled
- **Specificity** -- references actual project context, not generic boilerplate
- **Traceability** -- cross-references between artifacts present and correct
- **Actionability** -- a vendor or review board could use this document as-is
- **Clarity** -- well-structured, no contradictions

The combined score is the arithmetic mean, rounded to one decimal place.

Scoring uses an adversarial reviewer persona to prevent self-evaluation bias.

## What Gets Modified (and What Doesn't)

**Editable** (the only variables):

- `arckit-claude/commands/<command>.md` -- the prompt being optimised, including `effort:` and `model:` YAML frontmatter fields

**Read-only** (the fixed benchmark):

- Template file (defines expected output structure)
- Quality checklist (evaluation standard)
- Scratch project fixtures (controlled input)
- Test argument (`$ARGUMENTS = "001"`)
- Evaluation rubric

This mirrors autoresearch's design: `prepare.py` is read-only, `train.py` is the only file modified.

---

## Constraints

- **One change per iteration** -- isolate variables (prompt text, effort, or model -- not multiple at once)
- **Minimum delta of 0.3** -- filters noise from non-deterministic evaluation
- **Simplicity criterion** -- marginal improvement + added complexity = not worth it; simplification + same score = keep
- **Log everything** -- every iteration gets a row in `results.tsv` including effort and model values
- **No git reset --hard** -- use targeted `git checkout` + revert commits

---

## Results

Results are logged to `results.tsv` (tab-separated):

```text
commit  structural  score  effort  model    status   description
a1b2c3d PASS        8.4    high    inherit  keep     baseline
b2c3d4e PASS        8.8    high    inherit  keep     expand NFR subcategories
c3d4e5f PASS        9.0    high    inherit  discard  derive NFR targets from context (delta < 0.3)
d4e5f6g PASS        9.2    high    inherit  keep     add use case structure instruction
e5f6g7h PASS        9.1    max     inherit  discard  changed effort to max (no improvement)
```

Status values: `keep`, `discard`, `plateau`, `crash`.

### Plateau Detection

If 15 consecutive iterations are discarded, the system shifts strategy:

- Re-reads the template for unaddressed sections
- Reviews the quality checklist for uncovered criteria
- Tries prompt simplification
- Combines ideas from previous near-misses
- Tries changing `effort:` or `model:` if not already tested

## Practical Results

Commands optimised so far and their score improvements:

- **requirements**: 8.4 to 9.2 (+0.8) in 3 iterations
  - Expanded NFR subcategories (5 generic to 7 specific with sub-prefixes)
  - Added explicit use case structure (UC-xxx with main/alt/exception flows)
- **adr**: 8.6 to 9.0 (+0.4) in 1 iteration
  - Strengthened Consequences section with project-specific metrics, mitigation owners, after-action review
- **backlog**: 8.0 to 8.8 (+0.8) in 1 iteration
  - Strengthened acceptance criteria rules (banned vague phrases, required measurable thresholds)

Net prompt changes are typically 3-8 lines. The improvements are small and high-leverage.

---

## Which Commands to Optimise

Good candidates:

- Commands that produce long, structured documents (requirements, backlog, sobc, risk)
- Commands with detailed templates that the prompt may not fully leverage
- Commands where output quality varies between runs

Not suitable:

- Agent-delegated commands without a direct-execution fallback (research, datascout, aws-research, azure-research, gcp-research, framework) -- the prompt is a thin wrapper
- Simple utility commands (customize, init, health) -- too short to benefit

---

## File Structure

```text
scripts/autoresearch/
  program.md              # The instruction file Claude follows
  fixtures/
    000-global/
      ARC-000-PRIN-v1.0.md    # Architecture principles (6 principles)
    001-test-project/
      README.md                # Project description
      ARC-001-STKE-v1.0.md    # Stakeholder analysis (4 stakeholders)
```

The experiment runs in a **git worktree** (`../autoresearch-<command>`), keeping the main checkout clean. The scratch project, results TSV, and all experiment commits live in the worktree. The branch tip (the improved command `.md`) is the deliverable.

---

## Tips

- **Run overnight** -- each iteration takes 2-3 minutes, so you get 20-30 experiments per hour
- **Extend the prompt cache TTL for overnight runs** -- set `ENABLE_PROMPT_CACHING_1H=1` (Claude Code v2.1.108+) before launching Claude. The default 5-minute prompt cache expires between iterations once Claude pauses to think, score, and write `results.tsv`; the 1-hour TTL keeps the template, fixtures, and accumulated `results.tsv` warm across the full overnight run, materially reducing token cost. Pair with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` billing dashboards to confirm cache-read rates climb.
- **Review the results.tsv** -- the discard history tells you what didn't work, which is as valuable as what did
- **Check against standards** -- before starting a run, review relevant external standards (e.g., UK Gov ADR Framework for ADRs, GDS Service Standard for assessments) to prime the system with specific gaps to target
- **Create a PR for the prompt change only** -- the experiment branch has noise (scratch files, results, reverts); cherry-pick the kept commits onto a clean branch
- **One command per worktree** -- each optimisation run gets its own `../autoresearch-<command>` worktree
- **Cleanup** -- after cherry-picking results, remove the worktree: `git worktree remove ../autoresearch-<command>`

---

## Limitations

- **Self-evaluation bias** -- the same model generates and judges; adversarial scoring instructions mitigate but don't eliminate this
- **Fast convergence** -- most commands reach 8.8-9.2 within 2-3 kept changes; further improvements are incremental
- **Fixture dependency** -- a thin test project constrains what improvements the system can discover; richer fixtures reveal more gaps
- **Non-deterministic scoring** -- the 0.3 delta threshold is empirically chosen; genuine improvements near the threshold may be discarded
