# PSSI (Information System Security Policy) Playbook

> **Guide Origin**: Community | **ArcKit Version**: [VERSION]

`/arckit:fr-pssi` generates an Information System Security Policy (PSSI) for French public sector entities, following ANSSI PSSI guidance and RGS v2 requirements. The PSSI must be approved and signed by the Highest Authority (AA — Autorité d'Approbation).

## One-Page Workflow

| Phase | Key Activities | ArcKit Commands |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| Foundation | Requirements, risk, cartography | `/arckit:fr-ebios`, `/arckit:fr-anssi-carto` |
| Baseline | ANSSI 42 measures | `/arckit:fr-anssi` |
| Policy | Generate PSSI | `/arckit:fr-pssi` |
| DR | DR handling policy section | `/arckit:fr-dr` |

## Review Checklist

- AA (Highest Authority) identified and prepared to sign.
- IS scope matches cartography Level 1 missions.
- 8+ security principles documented.
- All 7 security domains covered with specific measures.
- RSSI, DPO, DSI, FSSI roles defined with named individuals or positions.
- EBIOS RM study referenced for risk analysis basis.
- 3-year review cycle defined with explicit update triggers.
- User obligations accessible and acknowledged (awareness programme planned).
- Document classified OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE.

## Key Notes

- **AA signature is mandatory**: the PSSI without AA approval has no legal standing in the French public sector context.
- **Living document**: PSSI must be updated when IS changes significantly — not a set-and-forget document.
- **Analogous to**: ISO 27001 ISMS policy, but specific to French public IS governance.
