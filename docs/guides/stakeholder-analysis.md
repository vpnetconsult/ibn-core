# Stakeholder Analysis Guide

> **Guide Origin**: Official | **ArcKit Version**: [VERSION]

`/arckit:stakeholders` maps stakeholders to drivers, goals, outcomes, and engagement plans—forming the backbone for requirements, risks, and communications.

## Stakeholder Canvas

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Role / Name | Individual or group | “Chief Finance Officer (CFO)” |
| Power / Interest | High / Medium / Low | “High power / High interest” |
| Drivers | Strategic, Operational, Financial, Compliance, Risk, Personal, Customer | “Financial – reduce run costs; Risk – avoid outages” |
| Goals | SMART statement derived from drivers | “Cut hosting costs by 30% within 12 months” |
| Outcomes | Measurable evidence that goal achieved | “Monthly FinOps report shows £1.8m annual saving” |
| Engagement | Communication cadence & format | “Weekly steering meeting, finance dashboard” |

ArcKit produces this structure automatically; use it during workshops to confirm accuracy.
