# Technology Code of Practice Playbook

> **Guide Origin**: Official | **ArcKit Version**: [VERSION]

`/arckit:tcop` generates a Technology Code of Practice (TCoP) review document for UK Government technology projects.

> **Parent standard**: TCoP is the implementation guidance for [GovS 005 — Government Functional Standard for Digital](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-functional-standard-govs-005-digital). A TCoP review satisfies the majority of GovS 005 obligations.

## Inputs

| Artefact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Requirements (`ARC-<id>-REQ-v1.0.md`) | What the project delivers |
| Architecture diagrams | Technical design and components |
| Architecture principles | Governance alignment |
| Stakeholder drivers | Business context |

## Command

```bash
/arckit:tcop Create TCoP review for <project>
```

Output: `projects/<id>/ARC-<id>-TCOP-v1.0.md`

> **Auto-versioning**: Re-running this command when a document already exists automatically increments the version (minor for refreshed content, major for changed scope) instead of overwriting.

## Compliance Levels

| Level | Description |

| Compliant | Fully meets the point with evidence |
| Partially Compliant | Meets some aspects, gaps identified |
| Not Compliant | Does not meet the point |
| Not Applicable | Point doesn't apply to this project |

## One-Page Workflow

| Phase | Key Activities | ArcKit Commands |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| Discovery | Define requirements and users | `/arckit:requirements`, `/arckit:stakeholders` |
| Architecture | Design solution | `/arckit:diagram`, `/arckit:hld-review` |
| Compliance | Create TCoP review | `/arckit:tcop` |
| Approval | Submit for spend control | Manual |
| Delivery | Build with TCoP compliance | `/arckit:backlog` |

## Spend Control Thresholds

| Threshold | Review Required |

## Key Principles

1. **User First**: Start with user needs, not technology.
2. **Open by Default**: Use open source and open standards.
3. **Cloud First**: Default to cloud unless justified otherwise.
4. **Security Built-In**: Security from the start, not bolted on.
5. **Reuse Before Build**: Check for existing solutions first.
6. **GovS 005 Traceability**: Map each TCoP point back to its parent GovS 005 principle for audit trail.
