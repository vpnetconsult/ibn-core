## Review Checklist

- In-scope determination: product with digital elements, EU market, no sector exclusion (MDR/EASA/automotive).
- Open source scenario assessed (steward lighter obligations vs commercial).
- Risk classification determined with Annex III reference.
- All 12 Annex I Part I security requirements assessed.
- SBOM produced in SPDX or CycloneDX format.
- VDP published with accessible contact mechanism.
- 24h ENISA + CERT-FR reporting capability assessed.
- CE marking and EU Declaration of Conformity plan in place.

## Key Notes

- **SBOM is mandatory**, not a best practice — minimum top-level dependencies in machine-readable format.
- **Default passwords are explicitly prohibited** by CRA.
- **ANSSI** is the French CRA market surveillance authority.
- **Open source stewards** (non-commercial foundations) have lighter obligations — document this clearly.
