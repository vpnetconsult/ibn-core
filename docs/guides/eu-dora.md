## Review Checklist

- All 5 ICT risk management pillars assessed.
- Major incident classification criteria documented (4h early warning threshold).

## Key Notes

- **France**: DORA supervised by ACPR (banking/insurance) and AMF (investment firms).
- **NIS2 relationship**: DORA is lex specialis for financial entities — NIS2 does not apply to DORA-regulated entities.
- **TLPT**: Threat-Led Penetration Testing follows TIBER-EU methodology; only required for significant institutions designated by competent authorities.
