## Key Principles

1. **Fair Competition**: Search broadly to find all suitable services.
2. **SME Consideration**: Government aims for 33% SME spend.
3. **Requirement Focus**: Search based on needs, not familiar vendors.
4. **Document Everything**: Record search criteria for audit trail.
5. **Compare Fairly**: Use consistent criteria across services.
