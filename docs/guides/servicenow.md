## CMDB CI Classes

| CI Class | Examples | Relationships |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Business Service | "Customer Portal" | Depends on Technical Services |
| Technical Service | "API Gateway" | Runs on Applications |
| Application | "Portal Frontend" | Runs on Servers/Containers |
| Server | "web-server-01" | Hosted on Hardware/Cloud |
| Database | "PostgreSQL Cluster" | Stores data for Applications |
| Network Device | "Load Balancer" | Connects to Servers |

---

## Incident Priority Matrix

| Impact / Urgency | High | Medium | Low |
|------------------|------|--------|-----|
| **High** | P1 (Critical) | P2 (High) | P3 (Moderate) |
| **Medium** | P2 (High) | P3 (Moderate) | P4 (Low) |
| **Low** | P3 (Moderate) | P4 (Low) | P5 (Planning) |

---

## SLA Response/Resolution Targets

| Priority | Response | Resolution | Support Hours |
|----------|----------|------------|---------------|
| P1 | 15 minutes | 4 hours | 24/7 |
| P2 | 30 minutes | 8 hours | 24/7 |
| P3 | 4 hours | 24 hours | Business hours |
| P4 | 8 hours | 72 hours | Business hours |
| P5 | 24 hours | 2 weeks | Business hours |

---

## Change Types

| Change Type | Approval | Lead Time | Example |
|-------------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Standard | Pre-approved | Immediate | Password reset, minor config |
| Normal | CAB | 5 days | New feature deployment |
| Emergency | Emergency CAB | Immediate | Critical security patch |

---

## One-Page Workflow

| Phase | Key Activities | ArcKit Commands |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| Discovery | Define service and requirements | `/arckit:requirements`, `/arckit:stakeholders` |
| Architecture | Design components and dependencies | `/arckit:diagram`, `/arckit:hld-review` |
| Operations | Create operational readiness | `/arckit:operationalize` |
| ITSM Design | Create ServiceNow design | `/arckit:servicenow` |
| Implementation | Configure ServiceNow, populate CMDB | `/arckit:backlog` |

---

## Integration Points

| System | Integration Type | Purpose |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| Monitoring (Prometheus, Datadog) | Event Management | Auto-create incidents from alerts |
| CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions) | Change Management | Auto-create change records |
| Cloud Provider (AWS, Azure) | Discovery | Auto-populate CMDB |
| Identity Provider (Azure AD) | User Management | SSO, group sync |
| Communication (Slack, Teams) | Notifications | Incident updates, approvals |

---

## Review Checklist

- CMDB design covers all architecture components.
- CI relationships reflect actual dependencies.
- SLAs align with NFRs and business expectations.
- Incident categories match service components.
- Change management process appropriate for service criticality.
- Knowledge base structure defined with review cycle.
- Integrations defined for monitoring, CI/CD, and discovery.
- Automation opportunities identified (auto-assignment, auto-remediation).

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Description | Target |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| CMDB Accuracy | % of CIs with correct data | >95% |
| SLA Achievement | % of incidents meeting SLA | >95% |
| First Contact Resolution | % resolved at L1 | >70% |
| Change Success Rate | % of changes without incidents | >95% |
| MTTR | Mean time to resolve incidents | Trending down |

## Key Principles

1. **CMDB as Source of Truth**: All service relationships mapped and maintained.
2. **ITIL Alignment**: Follow ITIL v4 practices for service management.
3. **Automation First**: Automate ticket creation, routing, and remediation.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular service reviews and CSI initiatives.
5. **Integration**: Connect ServiceNow to monitoring, CI/CD, and cloud platforms.
