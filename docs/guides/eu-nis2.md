## Review Checklist

- Entity classification (Essential vs Important) determined with sector reference.
- French OIV/OSE designation assessed (LPM Article 22 for OIV).
- All 10 Art. 21 minimum measures assessed.
- 24h/72h/30-day incident reporting pipeline ready.
- Management body training and accountability documented.
- Supply chain ICT risk management programme in place.
- ANSSI as competent authority for France documented.

## Key Notes

- **France**: NIS2 transposed via LPM (Loi de Programmation Militaire). OIV obligations are stricter than NIS2 minimums.
- **CRA overlap**: For product manufacturers, the CRA incident reporting obligations overlap with NIS2 — run `/arckit:eu-cra`.
- **DORA overlap**: For financial entities, DORA replaces NIS2 for ICT risk — run `/arckit:eu-dora` instead.
