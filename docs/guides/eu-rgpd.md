## One-Page Workflow

| Phase | Key Activities | ArcKit Commands |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| Discovery | Data model and requirements | `/arckit:requirements`, `/arckit:data-model` |
| Risk | DPIA for high-risk processing | `/arckit:dpia` |
| Assessment | GDPR compliance assessment | `/arckit:eu-rgpd` |
| French layer | CNIL-specific requirements | `/arckit:fr-rgpd` |

## Review Checklist

- Lawful basis documented for each processing activity.
- DPO obligation assessed (public authority / large-scale / special categories).
- Data subject rights mechanisms operational (SAR response ≤ 1 month).
- International transfer safeguards in place (SCCs / BCRs / adequacy).
- 72-hour breach notification capability assessed.
- Processor agreements (Article 28) in place for all processors.
- Retention periods defined and enforced.
- DPIA conducted for high-risk processing (run `/arckit:dpia` first).

## Key Notes

- **French layer**: Run `/arckit:fr-rgpd` for CNIL-specific obligations (health data, cookies, age 15 for minors).
- **DPIA**: For high-risk processing, a DPIA under Article 35 is mandatory — run `/arckit:dpia` before this command.
- **Scope**: This command covers EU GDPR. UK GDPR (post-Brexit) is covered by `/arckit:dpia` with UK ICO context.
