## Key Notes

- **ARCOM** (Autorité de Régulation de la Communication Audiovisuelle et Numérique) is the French Digital Services Coordinator — enforcement body for France-established providers.
- **Micro/small exemptions are real**: platforms below 50 FTE AND €10M are exempt from Art. 21 out-of-court dispute settlement and Art. 27 recommender transparency.
- **VLOP designation is Commission-driven**: the 45M threshold triggers notification — the Commission formally designates.
