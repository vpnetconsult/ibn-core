## Security Classification (Civilian)

| Classification | Description | Controls |
|----------------|-------------|----------|
| OFFICIAL | Majority of government data | Standard controls |
| OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE | More sensitive OFFICIAL | Enhanced access control |

## UK Government Cyber Security Standard

The [UK Government Cyber Security Standard](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-cyber-security-standard) (July 2025, Cabinet Office) builds on the NCSC CAF by mandating:

- **CAF Baseline/Enhanced profiles** — departments must achieve the appropriate CAF profile for their systems
- **GovAssure** — annual assurance process for critical government systems, validated by NCSC
- **Secure by Design high-confidence profiles** — self-assessment against SbD principles (secure development, deployment, and operation)
- **Exception management** (clauses 4.3/4.4) — formal register for any non-compliance, with risk assessment and improvement plans
- **Cyber Action Plan alignment** — departmental participation in the £210m cross-government investment across four pillars (Skills, Tooling, Resilience, Collaboration)

The `/arckit:secure` assessment includes dedicated sections (9.1–9.4) for tracking GovAssure status, SbD confidence ratings, CSS exceptions, and Cyber Action Plan alignment alongside the existing CAF assessment.

## GovS 007: Security (Functional Standard)

[GovS 007: Security](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-functional-standard-govs-007-security) is the parent functional standard for all protective security across central government. It defines nine principles, a security lifecycle, and protective security disciplines (physical, personnel, cyber, technical, industry).

The `/arckit:secure` assessment maps GovS 007's nine principles to the CAF assessment evidence and related ArcKit artefacts (Section 10), demonstrating how operational security controls satisfy the higher-level governance requirements. Key security roles mandated by GovS 007 (SSRO, DSO, SIRO) are captured in both the security roles table and the approval sign-off section.

**Hierarchy**: GovS 007 → Cyber Security Standard → NCSC CAF → `/arckit:secure` assessment

| GovS 007 Principle | Evidenced By |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Governance | CAF A1, SIRO sign-off |
| Risk-based approach | CAF A2, `/arckit:risk` |
| Security in all activities | Secure Development (S4), Cloud Security (S5) |
| Holistic planning | Full CAF assessment (S1–S8) |
| Security culture | CAF B6 Staff Awareness, Government Cyber Security Profession (S11) |
| Accountability | Named SSRO/DSO/SIRO roles |
| Proportionate measures | Data classification → controls mapping |
| Continuous improvement | CAF D2 Improvements, Cyber Action Plan Alignment (S9.4) |
| Legal/regulatory compliance | UK GDPR (S3), `/arckit:dpia` |

## NCSC Vulnerability Monitoring Service (VMS)

The [VMS](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/information/vulnerability-monitoring-service) is an NCSC service that scans internet-facing systems across 6,000+ public sector bodies, with benchmarks of **8-day domain-specific** and **32-day general** vulnerability fix times. Departments achieving 84% faster fix times through VMS enrollment. The `/arckit:secure` assessment tracks VMS enrollment, coverage, and remediation performance against these benchmarks in Sections 1 (CAF C2) and 6.1 (VMS Integration).

---

## Government Cyber Security Profession & Cyber Action Plan

The [Government Cyber Security Profession](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-cyber-security-profession) establishes a career framework with Certified Cyber Professional (CCP) certification, DDaT role alignment, and the Government Cyber Academy. The [£210m Cyber Action Plan](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-cyber-action-plan) (February 2026) invests across four pillars: Skills & Workforce, Tooling & Infrastructure, Resilience & Response, and Collaboration & Sharing. The `/arckit:secure` assessment tracks profession participation (Section 11) and Cyber Action Plan alignment (Section 9.4).

---

## Key Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls.
2. **Least Privilege**: Minimum access necessary for function.
3. **Secure by Default**: Security is the default, not an option.
4. **Assume Breach**: Design for detection and response, not just prevention.
5. **Proportionate Security**: Controls match the risk and data sensitivity.
