# Project Plan Playbook

> **Guide Origin**: Official | **ArcKit Version**: [VERSION]

`/arckit:plan` creates a GDS-aligned delivery plan with phases, gates, dependencies, and Mermaid timelines.

---

## Inputs

| Artefact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Stakeholder analysis & principles | Populate governance roles and success criteria |
| Risk register & business case | Feed gate actions and critical path |
| Requirements overview | Determines key activities across phases |

---

## Command

```bash
/arckit:plan Create project plan for <initiative>
```

Output: `projects/<id>/ARC-<id>-PLAN-v1.0.md` plus Mermaid diagrams.

## Plan Structure

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| Timeline overview | Discovery → Alpha → Beta → Live with dates and milestones |
| Phase detail | Activities, deliverables, owners, entry/exit criteria |
| Gate checklist | Evidence required for GDS Discovery/Alpha/Beta/Live assessments |
| Dependency matrix | ArcKit commands sequenced with predecessors |
| Risk & mitigation | Key timeline threats with contingency |

---

## One-Page Workflow

| Phase | Key Activities | ArcKit Commands |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| Discovery | Stakeholders, problem framing, initial business case | `/arckit:stakeholders`, `/arckit:principles`, `/arckit:sobc` |
| Alpha | Detailed requirements, architecture, procurement | `/arckit:requirements`, `/arckit:diagram`, `/arckit:sow`, `/arckit:hld-review` |
| Beta | Build, test, operational readiness | `/arckit:dld-review`, `/arckit:backlog`, `/arckit:analyze`, `/arckit:servicenow` |
| Live | Go-live, transition to BAU, continuous improvement | `/arckit:story`, `/arckit:traceability`, `/arckit:analyze` (cadence) |

## Review Checklist

- Phases align to GDS guidance and organisational governance.
- Each gate lists approvers and evidence (business case, design review, DPIA).
- Dependencies cover compliance artefacts (TCoP, AI Playbook, Secure by Design).
- Buffer time included for procurement, assurance, and change freeze windows.
- Risks highlight delivery blockers (supplier delay, funding approval, staffing).

---

## Updating the Plan

- Refresh monthly and after major decisions; version documents in git.
- Share Mermaid Gantt to stakeholders via docs or static site.
- Feed changes into `/arckit:story` to capture project history.
