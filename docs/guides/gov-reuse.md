# Government Code Reuse Assessment Guide

> **Guide Origin**: Official | **ArcKit Version**: 4.4.0

`/arckit:gov-reuse` searches 24,500+ UK government open-source repositories to discover existing implementations that can be reused, forked, or referenced before building from scratch.

> **Agent Architecture**: This command runs as an autonomous agent via the Task tool. The agent performs multiple govreposcrape searches per capability and uses WebFetch to assess each candidate's GitHub repository, keeping the main conversation clean. The slash command is a thin wrapper that delegates to the agent.

## Prerequisites

### govreposcrape MCP Server (AUTO-INSTALLED)

This command uses the govreposcrape MCP server which is **automatically included** with the ArcKit plugin. No manual setup required.

**Endpoint**: `https://govreposcrape-api-1060386346356.us-central1.run.app/mcp`

### Project Prerequisites

- Requirements document (`ARC-*-REQ-*.md`) - **MANDATORY**
- Architecture principles (`ARC-000-PRIN-*.md`) - Recommended
- Stakeholder analysis (`ARC-*-STKE-*.md`) - Optional

## Scenario Matrix

| Scenario | Prompt seed | Focus |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| Pre-build check | "Check for existing government code for `<capability>`" | Capability-by-capability reuse search |
| Open source evaluation | "Find government open source for `<domain>`" | License and code quality assessment |
| UK Government project | "Assess government reuse for UK Government `<project>`" | OGL-licensed, GDS-standard code |
| Specific tech stack | "Find government `<language/framework>` implementations for `<use case>`" | Tech stack alignment |
| Cost reduction | "What can we reuse to reduce build effort for `<project>`?" | Effort savings estimation |

Add constraints (language, framework, license) in the prompt for tailored results.

---

## Command

```bash
/arckit:gov-reuse <capability or domain>
```

Outputs: `projects/<id>/research/ARC-<id>-GOVR-v1.0.md`

> **Auto-versioning**: Re-running this command when a document already exists automatically increments the version.

## How It Works

The agent uses the govreposcrape semantic search API to query 24,500+ UK government repositories:

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Extract capabilities from project requirements |
| 2 | Search govreposcrape with 3-5 query variations per capability |
| 3 | Fetch GitHub repo details via WebFetch for each candidate |
| 4 | Score candidates on 5 criteria (1-5 scale) |
| 5 | Recommend strategy: Fork, Library, Reference, or None |

### Scoring Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | 5 (Best) | 1 (Worst) |
|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| License compatibility | Equal | OGL / MIT | Proprietary |
| Code quality | Equal | Tests, CI, clean | No tests, unmaintained |
| Documentation | Equal | Comprehensive README, guides | No documentation |
| Tech stack alignment | Equal | Same stack | Incompatible |
| Activity / maintenance | Equal | Active (recent commits) | Abandoned (>2 years) |

## Output Highlights

- **Reuse candidates** per capability with scores and strategies
- **License compatibility matrix** across all candidates
- **Tech stack alignment** comparison with your project
- **Gap analysis** for capabilities with no reusable code
- **Effort savings** estimates vs building from scratch

---

## Follow-on Actions

- Run `/arckit:research` to feed reuse findings into build vs buy analysis
- Run `/arckit:adr` to document reuse decisions
- Run `/arckit:requirements` to refine requirements based on discovered capabilities

## Comparison with /arckit:research

| Feature | `/arckit:gov-reuse` | `/arckit:research` |
|---------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Scope | UK government repos only | Multi-cloud, SaaS, open-source |
| Focus | Code reuse and adaptation | Build vs buy, vendor comparison |
| Source | govreposcrape + GitHub | Web search, vendor sites |
| Output | Reuse assessment with scoring | Market research with TCO |
| When to use | Before building, to find existing code | To evaluate commercial options |

**Workflow**: Run `/arckit:gov-reuse` first, then `/arckit:research` to compare reuse candidates against commercial alternatives.
