# UK Grants & Funding Research Playbook

> **Guide Origin**: Official | **ArcKit Version**: [VERSION]

`/arckit:grants` researches UK government grants, charitable funding, and accelerator programmes for the project, with eligibility scoring per programme. Runs as a research-heavy agent that produces a per-grant briefing plus reusable tech-notes.

## Inputs

| Artefact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Requirements (`ARC-<id>-REQ-v1.0.md`) | Project scope and outcomes |
| SOBC (`ARC-<id>-SOBC-v*.md`) | Strategic case and funding ask |
| Architecture principles (`ARC-000-PRIN-*.md`) | Eligibility-relevant principles (open source, accessibility, etc.) |

---

## Command

```bash
/arckit:grants <project ID or domain>
```

Outputs:

- `projects/<id>/research/ARC-<id>-GRNT-NNN-v1.0.md` — per-grant briefing, one per programme researched
- `projects/<id>/tech-notes/<grant-slug>.md` — reusable knowledge note per programme (when 2+ substantive facts captured)

## Briefing Structure

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| Programme Overview | Funder, scheme name, total fund, individual grant size |
| Eligibility | Sector, organisation type, project stage, geography, IP requirements |
| Eligibility Scoring | Project's fit against each criterion with rationale |
| Application Process | Stages, gates, deadlines, panel / peer review model |
| Match Funding & Co-Investment | Funder match rules, partner requirements |
| Reporting & Compliance | Milestone reporting, audit, IP and dissemination obligations |
| Decision | Pursue / monitor / discard with rationale |
| External References | Programme guidance, recent awards, funder priorities |

## One-Page Workflow

| Phase | Key Activities | ArcKit Commands |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|
| Discovery | Project scope and outcomes | `/arckit:requirements` |
| Funding research | Programme scan + eligibility scoring | `/arckit:grants` |
| Business case | Folding funding into Economic Case | `/arckit:sobc` |
| Plan | Align project plan to grant milestones | `/arckit:plan` |
| Risk | Grant-specific risks (rejection, compliance, reporting) | `/arckit:risk` |

---

## Review Checklist

- At least one programme researched per relevant funder family.
- Eligibility scoring shows rationale per criterion (not just a number).
- Match-funding requirements identified for every "pursue" recommendation.
- Reporting and IP obligations called out before "pursue" decision.
- Pursue / monitor / discard decision recorded for every programme.
- Funding inputs handed off to SOBC Economic Case and project plan.
- Grant-specific risks added to the risk register.

## Key Notes

- **Agent command**: Heavy WebSearch / WebFetch — runs as the `arckit-grants` autonomous agent in Claude Code; the slash command is a thin wrapper.
- **Tech notes**: Programmes worth detailed study spawn a reusable tech-note that future projects can read without re-running the research.
- **Plan alignment**: Grants impose milestone and reporting cadences that must be reflected in the project plan — do not skip the `/arckit:plan` handoff.
- **Multi-instance numbering**: `GRNT-001`, `GRNT-002`, etc. — one document per programme, generated automatically.
