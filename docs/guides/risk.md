## Key Principles

1. **Risk-Informed Decisions**: Use risk to guide project decisions.
2. **Proportionate Response**: Treatment effort matches risk severity.
3. **Clear Ownership**: Every risk has a named owner.
4. **Regular Review**: Risks change; register must be living document.
5. **Escalation Culture**: High risks escalate promptly to senior leaders.
