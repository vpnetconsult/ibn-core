# Statement of Work Playbook

> **Guide Origin**: Official | **ArcKit Version**: [VERSION]

`/arckit:sow` generates a Statement of Work (SOW) or RFP document for vendor procurement.

---

## Inputs

| Artefact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Requirements (`ARC-<id>-REQ-v1.0.md`) | What must be delivered |
| Architecture principles | Technical standards and constraints |
| Stakeholder drivers | Business context and success criteria |
| Risk register | Risks for vendor to manage |

---

## Command

```bash
/arckit:sow Create Statement of Work for <project>
```

Output: `projects/<id>/ARC-<id>-SOW-v1.0.md`

> **Auto-versioning**: Re-running this command when a document already exists automatically increments the version (minor for refreshed content, major for changed scope) instead of overwriting.

## Commercial Models

| Model | When to Use | Risk Profile |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| Fixed Price | Well-defined scope | Vendor carries risk |
| Time & Materials | Uncertain scope | Buyer carries risk |
| Outcome-Based | Measurable outcomes | Shared risk |
| Mixed | Combination | Balanced risk |

## Key Principles

1. **Clarity**: Vendors must understand exactly what's required.
2. **Fairness**: Requirements shouldn't favor one vendor.
3. **Measurability**: Deliverables must be objectively assessable.
4. **Completeness**: Cover all aspects of the engagement.
5. **Flexibility**: Allow for appropriate change management.
