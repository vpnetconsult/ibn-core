```

### For platform projects

```text
plan → principles → stakeholders → risk → sobc → requirements → platform-design → strategy → roadmap
```

### Step-by-step

1. **Plan the project**: Run `/arckit:plan` for project timeline and phases
2. **Set principles**: Contribute business principles to `/arckit:principles`
3. **Map stakeholders**: Run `/arckit:stakeholders` to identify drivers, goals, and power dynamics
4. **Assess risks**: Review `/arckit:risk` for business and strategic risks
5. **Build business case**: Run `/arckit:sobc` with Green Book 5-case model (Strategic, Economic, Commercial, Financial, Management)
6. **Design platform** (if applicable): Run `/arckit:platform-design` for ecosystem strategy
7. **Synthesise strategy**: Run `/arckit:strategy` to combine all strategic inputs
8. **Plan evolution**: Run `/arckit:roadmap` for multi-year capability roadmap
