## Typical Workflow

```text
plan → stakeholders → requirements → backlog → trello → traceability → story
```

### Step-by-step

1. **Plan the project**: Run `/arckit:plan` for phases, milestones, and governance gates
2. **Understand stakeholders**: Review `/arckit:stakeholders` to know who needs what
3. **Define requirements**: Run `/arckit:requirements` — prioritise BR-xxx and FR-xxx with MoSCoW
4. **Generate backlog**: Run `/arckit:backlog` to convert requirements into user stories and sprints
5. **Export to tooling**: Run `/arckit:trello` to push backlog to Trello for team collaboration
6. **Check coverage**: Run `/arckit:traceability` to verify all requirements have backlog items
7. **Health check**: Run `/arckit:health` periodically to catch orphaned requirements
8. **Tell the story**: Run `/arckit:story` at milestones to communicate progress
