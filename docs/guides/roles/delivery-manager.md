## Overview

The Delivery Manager ensures the project is delivered on time and to quality standards. You use ArcKit to track plans, risks, backlogs, and traceability — giving you visibility across all project artifacts to identify blockers and governance gaps.

| `/arckit:backlog` | Generate and review product backlog for sprint planning | [Guide](#docs/guides/backlog.md) |
| `/arckit:trello` | Export backlog to Trello for team visibility | [Guide](#docs/guides/trello.md) |
| `/arckit:traceability` | Track requirements through design to tests — identify gaps | [Guide](#docs/guides/traceability.md) |
| `/arckit:health` | Scan for stale artifacts, orphaned requirements, and version drift | [Guide](#docs/guides/artifact-health.md) |

## Secondary Commands

| Command | Your Involvement | Guide |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| `/arckit:stakeholders` | Review stakeholder map for delivery dependencies | [Guide](#docs/guides/stakeholder-analysis.md) |
| `/arckit:requirements` | Track requirements completion status | [Guide](#docs/guides/requirements.md) |
| `/arckit:story` | Generate project narrative for governance reporting | [Guide](#docs/guides/story.md) |

## Typical Workflow

```text
plan → stakeholders → risk → requirements → backlog → trello →
traceability → health → story
```

### Step-by-step

1. **Plan delivery**: Run `/arckit:plan` for timeline, phases, and governance gates
2. **Map stakeholders**: Ensure `/arckit:stakeholders` captures delivery dependencies
3. **Track risks**: Run `/arckit:risk` and review regularly — update mitigations as project progresses
4. **Monitor requirements**: Track completion of requirements from `/arckit:requirements`
5. **Manage backlog**: Run `/arckit:backlog` then `/arckit:trello` for sprint-level tracking
6. **Check traceability**: Run `/arckit:traceability` to ensure nothing falls through the cracks
7. **Health checks**: Run `/arckit:health` periodically to catch drift and stale artifacts
8. **Report progress**: Run `/arckit:story` for governance board updates
