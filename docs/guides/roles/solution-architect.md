## Overview

The Solution Architect designs technical solutions to meet business requirements. You own the research, decision-making, and design phases — translating requirements into architecture that can be reviewed, built, and operated.

## Primary Commands

| Command | Purpose | Guide |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `/arckit:requirements` | Define comprehensive business and technical requirements (with Business Analyst) | [Guide](#docs/guides/requirements.md) |

| `/arckit:gcp-research` | Deep-dive GCP services via Google Developer Knowledge MCP | [Guide](#docs/guides/gcp-research.md) |
| `/arckit:wardley` | Map strategic landscape for build vs buy decisions | [Guide](#docs/guides/wardley.md) |
| `/arckit:adr` | Document architecture decisions with options analysis | [Guide](#docs/guides/adr.md) |
| `/arckit:diagram` | Create architecture diagrams (C4 context, container, sequence, dataflow) | [Guide](#docs/guides/diagram.md) |
| `/arckit:hld-review` | Review High-Level Design against principles and requirements | [Guide](#docs/guides/hld-review.md) |

| `/arckit:sow` | Contribute technical sections to Statement of Work | [Guide](#docs/guides/sow.md) |
| `/arckit:evaluate` | Lead technical evaluation of vendor proposals | [Guide](#docs/guides/evaluate.md) |
| `/arckit:backlog` | Review backlog for technical feasibility | [Guide](#docs/guides/backlog.md) |
| `/arckit:traceability` | Verify requirements trace through to design and tests | [Guide](#docs/guides/traceability.md) |
| `/arckit:devops` | Input on CI/CD and infrastructure patterns | [Guide](#docs/guides/devops.md) |

## Typical Workflow

```text
requirements → research → cloud-research → wardley → adr →
diagram → hld-review → dld-review → traceability
```

### Step-by-step

1. **Understand the problem**: Review stakeholders and business case from Business Architect
2. **Define requirements**: Run `/arckit:requirements` (co-own with Business Analyst)
3. **Research solutions**: Run `/arckit:research` for market analysis and build vs buy
4. **Cloud deep-dive**: Run `/arckit:azure-research`, `/arckit:aws-research`, or `/arckit:gcp-research` for specific platforms
5. **Map the landscape**: Run `/arckit:wardley` to visualise component evolution
6. **Record decisions**: Run `/arckit:adr` for each significant architecture decision
7. **Create diagrams**: Run `/arckit:diagram` for C4 context, container, and sequence diagrams
8. **Write HLD**: Author the High-Level Design document (external to ArcKit)
9. **Review HLD**: Run `/arckit:hld-review` to validate against principles and requirements
10. **Detail design**: Author DLD, then run `/arckit:dld-review`
