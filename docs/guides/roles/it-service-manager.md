## Overview

The IT Service Manager ensures IT services are delivered effectively and efficiently. You use ArcKit to design ITSM processes, prepare operational readiness documentation, and manage cloud costs.

## Primary Commands

| Command | Purpose | Guide |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `/arckit:servicenow` | Design ServiceNow service management — CMDB, SLAs, incident, change, problem management | [Guide](#docs/guides/servicenow.md) |
| `/arckit:operationalize` | Create operational readiness pack — support model, runbooks, DR/BCP, on-call, handover | [Guide](#docs/guides/operationalize.md) |
| `/arckit:finops` | Create FinOps strategy — cloud cost management, optimization, governance, forecasting | [Guide](#docs/guides/finops.md) |

## Secondary Commands

| Command | Your Involvement | Guide |
|---------|-----------------|-------|
| `/arckit:requirements` | Review service-level requirements (SLAs, availability, support hours) | [Guide](#docs/guides/requirements.md) |
| `/arckit:risk` | Review operational risks and service continuity | [Guide](#docs/guides/risk.md) |
| `/arckit:backlog` | Review backlog for operational and support stories | [Guide](#docs/guides/backlog.md) |
| `/arckit:traceability` | Verify service requirements trace to operational design | [Guide](#docs/guides/traceability.md) |
| `/arckit:health` | Monitor artifact health for live service documentation | [Guide](#docs/guides/artifact-health.md) |
| `/arckit:diagram` | Review infrastructure and service diagrams | [Guide](#docs/guides/diagram.md) |

## Typical Workflow

```text
requirements → servicenow → finops → operationalize
```

### Step-by-step

1. **Understand SLAs**: Review service-level requirements from `/arckit:requirements`
2. **Design ITSM**: Run `/arckit:servicenow` for CMDB configuration, SLA design, incident workflows
3. **Plan cost management**: Run `/arckit:finops` for cloud cost governance and optimization
4. **Prepare for live**: Run `/arckit:operationalize` for runbooks, DR/BCP, and support handover
