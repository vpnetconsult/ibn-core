## Typical Workflow

```text
requirements → servicenow → operationalize → service-assessment → story
```

### Step-by-step

1. **Understand requirements**: Review NFR requirements for availability, performance, and support SLAs
2. **Design service management**: Run `/arckit:servicenow` for CMDB, SLAs, incident workflows, change control
3. **Prepare operations**: Run `/arckit:operationalize` for runbooks, DR/BCP, on-call rotas, and handover docs
4. **Assess readiness**: Run `/arckit:service-assessment` to evidence compliance against GDS Service Standard
5. **Report**: Run `/arckit:story` to document the service journey for governance
