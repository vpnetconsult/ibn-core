# Project Story Guide

> **Guide Origin**: Official | **ArcKit Version**: [VERSION]

`/arckit:story` produces a narrative history of your project—ideal for gate packs, retrospectives, and knowledge transfer.

---

## Inputs

- Multiple ArcKit artefacts committed (principles, stakeholders, requirements, plan, reviews, assessments).
- Git history or file timestamps available to build timelines.
- Optional: metrics dashboards or service performance data to embed.

---

## Command

```bash
/arckit:story Generate project story for <project>
```

Output: `projects/<id>/ARC-<id>-STORY-v1.0.md`

> **Auto-versioning**: Re-running this command when a document already exists automatically increments the version (minor for refreshed content, major for changed scope) instead of overwriting.

## When to Regenerate

| Moment | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Gate reviews (Discovery→Alpha, etc.) | Summarise progress and evidence |
| Quarterly portfolio reporting | Provide consistent executive view |
| Project closure | Archive knowledge for future teams |
| Major change or reset | Document rationale and new direction |

Store the story alongside meeting packs and share with stakeholders for transparency.
