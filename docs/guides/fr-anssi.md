## Key Notes

- **Scope**: Applicable to any French organisation (public or private) — not limited to OIV/OSE.
- **Cloud qualification**: ANSSI distinguishes SecNumCloud (French sovereign qualification) from other cloud certifications — the guide specifies which qualification level is appropriate for which data sensitivity.
- **ANSSI** = French national cybersecurity agency, analogous to the UK's NCSC.
