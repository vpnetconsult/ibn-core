## Key Principles

1. **Outcomes Over Outputs**: Buy results, not activities.
2. **Fair Competition**: Requirements shouldn't favor one supplier.
3. **Clear Evaluation**: Suppliers must know how they'll be scored.
4. **Realistic Budgets**: Underfunding leads to poor outcomes.
5. **Agile Friendly**: Structure work in phases, not big-bang delivery.
